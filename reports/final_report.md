# India's Economic Rise and Its Global Significance

This section provides a brief overview of India's economic growth and its recent rise to become the world's fourth-largest economy, surpassing Japan. India's GDP growth, fueled by a youthful population, government initiatives, and a thriving services sector, has positioned it as a key player in global markets. Meanwhile, Japan faces challenges with an aging demographic and stagnant growth. This comparative analysis underscores how India's surge not only changes the economic landscape but also has far-reaching implications for global trade dynamics and geopolitical relations, particularly in the context of a shifting balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region. Understanding these factors is vital for stakeholders navigating the new economic order.

## India's Economic Characteristics

**India is poised for sustained economic growth, projected at 6.5-7% for FY 2024-25.** This growth trajectory is bolstered by vibrant sectors such as agriculture, construction, and services. In Q4 FY 2024-25, GDP growth accelerated to 7.4%, principally driven by a robust agriculture sector expanding at 4.6% and construction registering an impressive 10.8% growth (DNA India, 2025).

Key growth factors include demographic advantages, with over 65% of the population under 35 years of age, positioned to drive consumer demand and innovation (S&P Global, 2024). Government initiatives like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme aim to enhance manufacturing capabilities across various sectors, ultimately fostering foreign direct investment (IBEF, 2025).

The Economic Survey 2024-25 highlights government spending on infrastructure, with capital expenditure growing by 28.2% year-on-year, as vital for sustaining growth (Press Information Bureau, 2024). This combination of demographic potential and strategic government policies has firmly positioned India as one of the fastest-growing economies globally.

## Economic Structure of Japan

**Japan faces significant economic challenges due to its aging population and declining workforce, impacting its competitive positioning globally.** As of 2023, more than 30% of the population is over the age of 65, projected to rise to approximately 40% by 2060 (Mitsui & Co. Global Strategic Studies Institute). This demographic shift threatens productivity and increases demand for healthcare and pensions, which are projected to further strain public finances (World Economic Forum).

Simultaneously, Japan remains the third-largest economy globally, leveraging its technological advancements, particularly in robotics and automation, to address labor shortages. For instance, Komatsu developed teleoperated excavators to enhance construction efficiency amid a labor crunch (Japan Finds Innovative Solutions to Counter Its Aging Headwind). The economy's reliance on technology is essential not only for maintaining output but also for innovating across sectors including agriculture, where robots are being used to automate rice cultivation, significantly increasing yields (Japan Finds Innovative Solutions to Counter Its Aging Headwind).

## Comparative Analysis of India and Japan's Economies

**India has surpassed Japan to become the world's fourth-largest economy, yet it faces significant challenges in per capita income.** As of 2024, India's nominal GDP reached approximately USD 3.91 trillion, compared to Japan's USD 4.196 trillion. However, India’s GDP per capita stands at about USD 2,500, starkly lower than Japan’s USD 34,000. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that India's GDP is on track to grow at 6.5% in 2025, while Japan's growth rate is forecasted at merely 1.1%.

Key drivers for India’s economic expansion include:
- A young and dynamic population.
- Rapid digital transformation and manufacturing initiatives like "Make in India."
- Strong domestic consumption and infrastructure development.

In contrast, Japan grapples with structural issues, including an aging population and stagnant growth. This demographic challenge hinders its ability to sustain robust economic performance. For instance, Japan’s economy has not substantially changed in the last two decades, emphasizing the importance of reform and adaptability in light of shifting global economic dynamics.

## Geopolitical Ramifications of India's Economic Rise

**India's ascent to the world's fourth-largest economy significantly alters its geopolitical influence and trade dynamics.** As reported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India’s nominal GDP reached approximately $4.19 trillion in 2025, surpassing Japan's economic standing. This transition enhances India's leverage in international forums like the G20 and BRICS, allowing it to shape global economic policies more assertively.

India's rise catalyzes potential shifts in alliances and economic partnerships. For instance, increasing trade with key partnerships in the Global South, particularly under initiatives like "Make in India" and "Atmanirbhar Bharat," reflects a strategic pivot away from dependency on China. Furthermore, as tensions evolve, India is seen as a counterbalance to China in the Indo-Pacific region, echoing Western interests in diversifying supply chains.

* Key developments include:
  - Strengthened ties with the U.S. and EU for trade agreements.
  - Expansion of the role within ASEAN for regional trade stability.
  - Enhanced global investment as a reliable manufacturing hub.

To sustain growth, India must address issues such as income inequality and infrastructure challenges while maintaining a diplomatic balance amid shifting geopolitical landscapes.
