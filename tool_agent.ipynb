      "Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) models to retrieve and incorporate new information. It modifies interactions with a large language model (LLM) so that the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this information to supplement information from its pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information.  Use cases include providing chatbot access to internal company data or generating responses based on authoritative sources.\n",
      "RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have led to real-world issues like chatbots inventing policies or lawyers citing nonexistent legal cases.\n",
      "By dynamically retrieving information, RAG enables AI to provide more accurate responses without frequent retraining. According to IBM, \"RAG also reduces the need for users to continuously train the model on new data and update its parameters as circumstances evolve. In this way, RAG can lower the computational and financial costs of running LLM-powered chatbots in an enterprise setting.\"\n",
      "Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include source references in their responses, enabling users to verify information by reviewing cited documents or original sources. This can provide greater transparency, as users can cross-check retrieved content to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n",

See how to use it on your desktop today.\\n\\n4 min read\\nAug 1, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLMs have paved the way for the development of new types of agentic applications ‚Äî and as LLM applications evolve, so must the tooling needed to efficiently develop them. Today, we're announcing LangGraph Studio - the first IDE designed specifically for agent development - in open beta.LangGraph Studio offers a new way to develop LLM applications, providing a specialized agent IDE for visualizing, interacting with, and debugging complex agentic applications. In this blog, we'll give a brief overview of LangGraph and then explore how LangGraph Studio streamlines the development of agentic applications.LangGraph: Balancing agent control with agency  In January 2023, we launched LangGraph, a highly controllable, low-level orchestration framework for building agentic applications. Since then, we've seen  teams build more complex agentic applications for production; in turn, we've heavily invested in LangGraph, leading to a stable 0.1 release this past June.LangGraph features a persistence layer that enables human-in-the-loop interactions, and it excels at building complex (i.e. more than a single LLM call) applications that require highly domain-specific cognitive architecture. Most of the agents we see in production fit this description.LangGraph is fully open source, available in both Python and Javascript. It works with or without LangChain, and integrates seamlessly with LangSmith.LangGraph Studio: Visualize and interact with agent graphs for quick iterationWhile LangGraph offers a new framework for developing agentic applications, we also strongly believe that new tooling is needed to make the development process easier. Building LLM applications differs from traditional software development, requiring different tooling outside of the traditional code editor.Coding is still important to developing LLM applications ‚Äî after all, production-ready LangGraph applications have complicated custom logic in the nodes and edges of the graphs that are created. We don't aim to replace code editors but, instead, to augment the development experience with tools tailored for LangGraph applications. LangGraph Studio facilitates this by making it easy to visualize and interact with agent graphs, even if development still primarily happens in code. Visualizing graphs helps developers understand their structure. Furthermore, you can modify an agent result (or the logic underlying a specific node) halfway through the agent's trajectory. This creates an iterative process, by letting you interact with and manipulate the state at that point in time.While there is much more to explore, we're excited to introduce LangGraph Studio to start with bringing some of the core features of an agent IDE to the world.How to use LangGraph StudioLangGraph Studio is a desktop app, currently available for Apple Silicon. You can download a version here. Support for more platforms is coming soon.After you download and open LangGraph Studio, you will be prompted to log in with your LangSmith account. All users of LangSmith (including those with free accounts) currently have access to LangGraph Studio while it is in beta. You can sign up for a LangSmith account here.After downloading LangSmith, you can open a directory. At a bare minimum, this directory needs to contain a Python file with a graph defined in it. Next, you will need to create a langgraph.json file containing details such as where the agent is defined, which dependencies to install, and which environment variables to load. This file can be created in the UI, or can exist as a file in the directory already. For an example repository which meets these requirements, see this GitHub repo.After you open a directory, we will build an environment for you agent to run. After it builds, you should see a visualization of the graph along with a box for interacting with the agent.When you interact with the agent, you'll get a stream of real-time information about what steps are happening. You can see the agent decide which tools to call, call those tools, and then continue looping. You can interrupt the agent at any time if veers off course, or you can interrupt the agent to run it in a ‚Äúdebug mode‚Äù where it pauses after each step of the graph (so you can walk-through step by step).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0:00\\n\\n                            /0:19\\n\\n\\n1√ó\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nüí°At any point, you can interact with the state of the agent.If you don‚Äôt like what the agent responded with at a specific step, you can directly modify the response and then continue with that new response.

LangGraph Studio facilitates this by making it easy to visualize and interact with agent graphs, even if development still primarily happens in code.

    "*ReAct Agent (Reasoning + Acting):*\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting in a single loop to handle tasks. The agent uses natural language reasoning (thinking through steps) and task actions (performing tasks like calculations or data retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The agent uses a combination of reasoning steps to guide actions in real-time, using feedback from those actions to further inform the next step in reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: The agent receives a question or task.\n",
    "* Step 2: It reasons aloud (in natural language) about how to solve it.\n",
    "* Step 3: Based on its reasoning, it takes actions (e.g., searching a database, calculating something).\n",
    "* Step 4: The results of these actions are integrated into its reasoning and may trigger further actions.\n",
    "* Step 5: It repeats the process until it arrives at a solution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combines thinking and doing (reasoning and actions).\n",
    "* Performs iterative steps, updating its process based on action results.\n",
    "* Typically handles complex decision-making scenarios.\n",
    "* \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Original task: ‚ÄúCalculate the total number of apples in a basket if there are 4 baskets and 7 apples in each.‚Äù\n",
    "* Reasoning: \"I need to multiply 4 by 7 to get the total number of apples.\"\n",
    "* Action: Perform the multiplication.\n",

    "*Self-Ask with Search Agent:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows the AI to ask itself follow-up questions when it doesn't immediately know the answer. It performs a recursive questioning process to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable ones.\n",
    "Once the AI generates these follow-up questions, it performs an external search (e.g., through Google or an internal database) to gather the necessary information before formulating a response.\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Receive a complex question.\n",
    "* Step 2: The agent identifies sub-questions or follow-up questions.\n",
    "* Step 3: It performs a search or fetches answers to these questions from external resources (like a web search).\n",
    "* Step 4: The answers are aggregated to provide a complete response.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Emphasizes question decomposition.\n",
    "Relies on external search for sub-questions.\n",
    "Useful for answering open-ended or broad questions where the answer is not immediately available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Original question: ‚ÄúHow many moons does Jupiter have?‚Äù\n",
    "* Sub-question: ‚ÄúWhat is Jupiter?‚Äù (search)\n",
    "* Sub-question: ‚ÄúWhat are moons?‚Äù (search)\n",
    "* Finally, it retrieves the answer: \"Jupiter has 79 moons.\""
